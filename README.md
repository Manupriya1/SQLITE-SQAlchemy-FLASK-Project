## Overview of the Project
In this project, I analysed weather data to decide if opening a surf & shake shop is a good investment in hawaii. I used SQLITE, SQAlchemy and Flask to study temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
## Results
### June Temperature and Statistical Data:

As we can see below the average temperature is around 75 degrees with standard deviatin of 3.2 degrees

### December Temperature and Statistical Data:

As we can see the average temperature is ~ 71 degrees and satndard deviation is 3.7 degrees

### comparison of June and December Data
- Max temperature: For june it is 85 degrees and for december it is 83 degrees
- Min. temperature: For june it is 64 degrees and for december it is 56 degrees
- Average temperature: For june it is 78 degreesa and for december it is 71 degrees
As it is evident from the analysis - Max, Min and average temepratures, that there is not drastic difference in the temperature between the month of June and December, which is a positive sign and takes us closer to one step closer to opening a surf and ice creame store.  

## Summary
This data looks encouraging, as the average temperatures in the month of june and december are not drastically different.  I am concerned aboutt he minimum temperatures in dec which is 56 degrees so at this point I would like to analyse:
- precipitation data for both months 
- and number of days on an average december has minimum temperature around 56 degrees. 
- Also I will analysis station data for precipitation and temerature data.
