# UCB-SQLITE-SQAlchemy-FLASK
## Overview of the Project
In this project, I analysed weather data to decide if opening a surf & shake shop is a good investment in hawaii. I used SQLITE, SQAlchemy and Flask to study temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
